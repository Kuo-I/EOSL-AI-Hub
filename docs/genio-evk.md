The Genio Evaluation Kits are designed to provide developers with a robust platform for AI and IoT applications. These kits support both Yocto and Ubuntu 22.04 operating systems, each offering unique advantages to cater to different development needs.

### Operating Systems:

* **Yocto**: Known for its high power performance, Yocto is ideal for developers who require a highly customizable and efficient OS. However, it may present a steeper learning curve due to its complexity.
* **Ubuntu 22.04**: This OS is more user-friendly and easier to develop on, making it suitable for developers who prioritize ease of use and rapid development.
