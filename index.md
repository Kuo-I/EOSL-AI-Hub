# Welcome to ITRI AI Hub Document

<p>
<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
The ITRI AI Hub provides a comprehensive AI infrastructure solution to help enterprises construct a portable AI system with <b>Compliant, Secure,</b> and <b>High Energy Efficiency</b>. Developers can find the optimal computing units on this platform for implementing various sophisticated applications.

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
<br>Imagine how important an Embedded AI with high durability is in a jungle with no internet connection. Let's suppose you're alone with your digital assistant, but unable to use its full functionality due to no internet connectivity. Embedded AI is able to efficiently process data and perform tasks on a local device, meaning that even when the internet is unavailable, your digital assistant can still identify dangerous animals and plants, provide voice survival guides, and monitor physiological conditions, among other key functions. A laptop workstation is an alternative solution. however, it may face challenges such as limited battery life. In contrast, using cloud-based AI involves bottlenecks such as finding network signals, connecting to the network, synchronizing data and requesting cloud services, all of which may not be completed in real-time during such emergencies, thereby compromising your safety and convenience.

## **Designed for AI Applications Everywhere**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
<br>This statement does not undermine the necessity of cloud computing and computational workstations; however, it acknowledges that embedded AI can be more reliable and energy-efficient in commercial scenarios. As the examples shown below, our AI application services cover a wide range of functions in different domains, including <b>vision, voice/signal, language</b>, and <b>processing and optimization</b>. In computer vision, we provide advanced image classification, object detection, character recognition and keypoint identification functions. These functions enable precise analysis and interpretation of image data. In speech and signal processing, we provide powerful text-to-speech, speech-to-text and time-series analysis functions. These services contribute to effective communication and signal processing. In the language domain, our AI services include sophisticated text understanding, entity extraction and question answering systems. These features enhance natural language understanding and interaction. In the processing and optimization area, dynamic planning, enhanced learning control and search engines are featured. These functions are designed to improve operational efficiency and decision-making processes.

## **What Can We Do?**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
It is imperative that we thoroughly understand the entire application environment and define the basic requirements of each functional unit, to determine where each microservice in the system should be delegated and the carriers. Furthermore, we are committed to integrating the latest embedded hardware solutions and conducting feasibility assessments for porting these functions. Our comprehensive reports will enable organizations to swiftly implement these advanced AI options into their systems, ensuring that private data remains close to the client host. Therefore, we build the AI Hub to help enterprises find more rational use of computing costs and resources. The following figure roughly shows the currently supported edge system inference benchmarks. These results are achieved through the engines of each major processor. You can evaluate whether these edge devices are suitable for your system configuration based on the underlying transfer efficiency, power consumption and computing speed.
