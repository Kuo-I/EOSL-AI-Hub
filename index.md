    As shown in the figure above, this service covers various domains such as computer vision, speech, voice, time series, and various other customized functions. In computer vision, it provides image classification, object detection, optical character recognition (OCR), keypoint detection, and other functions. Language functions include text categorization and comprehension, keyword extraction, entity extraction, and question answering. The voice function provides voice-to-text conversion, avatars, and translation. Time series functions include anomaly detection, trend analysis, control and clustering. In addition, the platform supports proof-of-concept with Azure AI services through data quality validation and feasibility assessment, and provides edge deployment options to bring data closer to the host.

## **Designed for AI Applications Everywhere**

    <br>Imagine how important an Edge AI with high endurance is in a jungle with no internet connection. Let's suppose you're alone in such a situation, with only your digital assistant at your side, but you can't use its full functionality due to the lack of internet connectivity. Edge AI is able to efficiently process data and perform tasks on a local device, meaning that even when the internet is unavailable, your digital assistant can still identify dangerous animals and plants, provide voice survival guides, and monitor physiological conditions, among other key functions. In contrast, using cloud-based AI involves bottlenecks such as finding network signals, connecting to the network, synchronising data and requesting cloud services, all of which may not be completed in real time during such emergencies, thereby compromising your safety and convenience.

## **What Can We Do?**

    <br>This statement does not undermine the necessity of cloud computing; however, it acknowledges that edge AI can be more reliable in certain specific scenarios. It is imperative that we thoroughly understand the entire application context and clearly define the fundamental requirements of each functional unit. This approach will enable us to distribute computing tasks across more reasonable platforms. Here are a few important evaluation metrics to start with:<br>
