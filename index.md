# Welcome to IRTI AI Hub Document

<p>
<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
The ITRI AI Hub provides a comprehensive AI infrastructure solution to help enterprises construct an portable AI system with <b>Compliant, Secure,</b> and <b>High Energy Efficiency</b>. Developers can find the optimal computing units on this platform for implementing various sophisticated applications.

<br>Imagine how important an Edge AI with high endurance is in a jungle with no internet connection. Let's suppose you're alone in such a situation, with only your digital assistant at your side, but you can't use its full functionality due to the lack of internet connectivity. Edge AI is able to efficiently process data and perform tasks on a local device, meaning that even when the internet is unavailable, your digital assistant can still identify dangerous animals and plants, provide voice survival guides, and monitor physiological conditions, among other key functions. In contrast, using cloud-based AI involves bottlenecks such as finding network signals, connecting to the network, synchronising data and requesting cloud services, all of which may not be completed in real time during such emergencies, thereby compromising your safety and convenience.

## **Designed for AI Applications Everywhere**

<br>As shown in the figure below, this service encompasses computer vision, speech, voice, time series, and various other customized functions. In computer vision, it provides image classification, object detection, optical character recognition (OCR), keypoint detection, and other functions. Language functions include text categorization and comprehension, keyword extraction, entity extraction, and question answering. The voice function provides voice-to-text conversion, avatars, and translation. Time series functions include anomaly detection, trend analysis, control and clustering. Additionally, we pre-assess the feasibility of embedding some of these functions into edge devices by integrating a variety of formal start-up deployment options. From our reports, organizations can gain quick insights into how these options can be applied to their system, bringing private data closer to the client's host.

### **What Can We Do?**

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
This statement does not undermine the necessity of cloud computing; however, it acknowledges that edge AI can be more reliable in certain specific scenarios. It is imperative that we thoroughly understand the entire application environment and define the basic requirements of each functional unit to determine where each microservice in the system should be delegated and the carriers, this approach will enable us to operate in a more rational use of computing costs and resources. The following figure roughly shows the currently supported edge system inference benchmarks. these results are achieved through the engines of each These results are achieved through the engines of each major processor. You can evaluate the configuration of edge devices based on underlying transfer efficiency, power consumption, and computational speed.
